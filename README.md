# cancer_detection

This initiative aims to engineer an algorithm capable of pinpointing metastatic cancer within small fragments of extensive digital pathology scans. Initially, we will delve into analyzing the dataset provided for this competition, to comprehensively understand it. Our strategy encompasses the deployment of three distinct convolutional neural network (CNN) models. These models are tasked with discerning between cancerous (labelled as 1) and non-cancerous cells (labelled as 0). Among these, the third model leverages transfer learning, employing a pre-trained network to enhance our capability in accurately classifying the cells. This approach not only promises to refine the precision of cancer detection but also accelerates the timeframe within which patients can begin receiving critical treatments. We plan to construct two models from scratchâ€”one without hyperparameter adjustments and another with fine-tuned hyperparameters. Additionally, the use of a pre-trained model introduces transfer learning into our methodology, potentially boosting our model's performance. In the final phase, we will evaluate our models and propose recommendations for further enhancing their effectiveness in future research endeavors.
